The task is to create two functions that can translate data between SQL and CSV formats
## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?
The problem is to create two functions, sql_to_csv and csv_to_sql, to convert data between SQL and CSV formats.
The challenge is in correctly handling data transformation between the two formats, ensuring data integrity, and dealing with potential errors and performance considerations. Proper testing and error handling are important for the functions to work correctly in various scenarios.

## Description
How have you solved the problem?
The problem has been solved by implementing two functions, sql_to_csv and csv_to_sql, to convert data between SQL and CSV formats.
In the sql_to_csv function:
The function connects to the SQLite database using the sqlite3 module.
It retrieves the column names of the specified table using the PRAGMA table_info() query and stores them in the column_names list.
It fetches all rows from the specified table using a SELECT * FROM query and stores them in the rows list.
It creates a CSV string by joining the column names with commas and appending each row as a comma-separated string followed by a newline.
The database connection is closed.
The function returns the CSV string.
In the csv_to_sql function:
The function reads the CSV content provided as a string using pd.read_csv(), which converts it to a DataFrame.
It connects to the SQLite database using the sqlite3 module.
It inserts the DataFrame data into the specified table in the database using data.to_sql().
The function closes the database connection.

## Installation
 How to install your project? npm install? make? make re?
There is no specific installation process required for this project. The code provided is written in Python, which is typically pre-installed on most systems. You just need to ensure that you have Python installed on your machine.
Usage:
To use the functions sql_to_csv and csv_to_sql
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Import the required modules:
import sqlite3
import csv
import pandas as pd
from io import StringIO
Copy and paste the sql_to_csv and csv_to_sql functions into your Python environment or script.
 make sure you have the required database file and CSV file available with the correct table names and data
## Usage
How does it work?
print(sql_to_csv('sourse_all_fault_line.db','fault_lines'))
csv_content = open("sourse_list_volcano.csv")
csv_to_sql(csv_content, 'list_volcanos.db','volcanos')
The function reads the CSV content as a string and converts it into a DataFrame using pd.read_csv().
It connects to the SQLite database and inserts the data from the DataFrame into the specified table using data.to_sql().
The function efficiently handles the conversion from CSV to SQL format and ensures that the data is correctly inserted into the database table.
